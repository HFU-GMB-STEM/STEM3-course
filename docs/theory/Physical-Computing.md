# What is Physical Computing?

* Creates a connection between the physical world and the virtual world of a computer.
* The flow between physical and virtual world is enabled by the process of **transduction**, the conversion of one form of energy into another.
* Focus on interactive systems by fusing software and hardware.
  
For creating interactive systems in your projects you'll need to use transducers to convert between the physical energy and electrical energy used by the computer.
A familiar transducer is a microphone: pressure waves are transformed to electrical voltage.
Another familiar transducer are speakers: electrical voltage are transformed to pressure waves.

Transducers are the eyes, ears, hands, legs, and mouth of any physical computing system.

With physical computing you'll have the opportunity to express and or enhance your creativity with embodied interaction.
