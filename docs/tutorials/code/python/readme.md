# Python sample application for ESP32 Serial Communication

## Photobooth Application

This is a simple Python application that communicates with an ESP32 microcontroller over a serial connection. The webcam access and image processing is done with OpenCV. The application allows users to control a photobooth setup by sending commands to the ESP32. See the [Touch Input to capture images](../../ESP32-05-TouchCapture.md) tutorial for more details.
