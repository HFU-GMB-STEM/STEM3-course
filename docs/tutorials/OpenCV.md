# OpenCV Tutorial

## Introduction

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains more than 2500 optimized algorithms for a wide range of computer vision tasks, including object detection, image processing, and video analysis. It is available since 1999 and has become one of the most popular libraries in the field of computer vision.

## Getting Started

The tutorials are provided as Jupyter Notebooks. To get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV library

## Notebooks

The following notebooks will guide you through various OpenCV functionalities:

- [01 OpenCV Basics](./notebooks/OpenCV-01-basics.ipynb): Introduction to OpenCV, image loading, and basic operations including color space conversions and webcam access.
- [02 OpenCV Image Transformations](./notebooks/OpenCV-02-image_transformations.ipynb): Image translation, rotation, resizing, and perspective transformations.
- [03 OpenCV Camera Calibration](./notebooks/OpenCV-03-camera_calibration.ipynb): Camera calibration with chessboard patterns, distortion correction, and real-world measurements.
