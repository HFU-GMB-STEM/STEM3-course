# Administration

## Course objectives

The STEM3 course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of physical computing, focusing on the integration of hardware and software to create interactive systems as well as camera image processing. The goal is to reduce the barriers between the physical and digital worlds, enabling students to design and implement games and immersive media projects that respond to real-world stimuli.

## Course structure

The course follows the for GMB usual structure of full day workshops and a high degree of self-directed learning. Each full day workshop focuses on a specific topic, such as physical computing with ESP32 microcontrollers or image processing with OpenCV. Between workshops, students are encouraged to work on their projects, applying the concepts and techniques learned during the workshops. The course culminates in a final project where students (*in pairs*) showcase their skills by creating a small interactive game or immersive media experience that combines physical computing and camera image processing.

## Grading

Grading is based on **participation in workshops** (40%), **completion and quality of assignments** (30%), and the **final project** (30%). Students are expected to actively engage in the learning process, collaborate with peers, and demonstrate their understanding of physical computing and image processing concepts through practical applications. The lecturers can provide feedback about grading and support throughout the course to help students succeed in their projects.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have a Github account and be familiar with Git version control. Some assignment tasks will require the use of Git for submission and collaboration via Github classrooms. If you do not have a Github account and do not want to create one, please contact the instructors for alternative arrangements.
