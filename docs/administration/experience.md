# Share your experience

We want to start the course by sharing your prior experience with physical computing, microcontrollers, and programming. This will help us to understand your background and tailor the course content accordingly. We also want to hear about your expectations for the course.

## Two truths and a lie

Note down **two true statements and one false statement** about your expectations for this course or about your experience with physical computing, microcontrollers, or programming. (3 minutes)

Combine all statements as you like, but ensure that only one of them is false.

Share these statements with the group, and let others guess which one is the lie. You don't have to reveal which one is the lie.
