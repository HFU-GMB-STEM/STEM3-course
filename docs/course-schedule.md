**Start:** 9:00
**End:** 17:00

**Content:**

- First tasks with ESP32: Combining ESP32 with computer, mini project camera booth (OpenCV)

**Details:**

- [Touch input to capture images](./tutorials/ESP32-05-TouchCapture.md) --> this is an exemplary project for combining ESP32 with computer via Serial communication.
- The first task is to build a controller using the ESP32. It should handle at least five different touch inputs and send signals to a PC via Serial communication. On the PC side, a simple Python program should read the serial input and display the received signals in the console. Implement a small game that uses the touch inputs to control a character or object on the screen.

**Start:** 9:00
**End:** 17:00

**Content:**

- Finishing and presenting ESP32 tasks

**Details:**

- If you have not finished the first ESP32 task, use the morning to complete it.
- In the afternoon (2:15pm), present your ESP32 projects to the class. Each person gets 5 minutes to showcase their work and explain their learning process.
- **Note that not just the presentations are judged, but also your curiosity about the other projects and your engagement during the presentations.**
